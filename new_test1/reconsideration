this file is dedicated to all things i could have done in this project but due to lack of time and not much experience
i failed.

1 - 'messenger' module
    lines: 15 to 18
    (((d = input('give an index to open the message or D/d for deleting ')
            num_format = re.compile(r'^\-?[0-9][0-9]*$')
            it_is = re.match(num_format, d)
            if it_is:)))

     -this part can get better if be replaced with try except. also adding a logging code to save errors caused by a non integer
     input could be make it perfect. so the reconsideration would be like:

     from logging_module import *

     d = input('give an index to open the message or D/d for deleting ')
     try:
       d = int(d)
       ...rest of the code
    except Exception:
        logger.error('a message')
---------------------------------------------
2- locking username account after 3 unsuccessful attempts
    -menu that i wrote cannot handle this feature, how it works? if you fail at log in, the whole menu will start over
again! it's like getting out of program and trying to open it once again.
also, Register module should be edited(like adding some variables or ... donno, didn't focus on this part)
---------------------------------------------
3- 'messenger' module
    -file handling in methods are not done very clean, that's why i used absolute addressing
    -also this module is very chaotic
---------------------------------------------
4- weak commenting
    -needed to comment on everything but not done well
---------------------------------------------
5- terrible variable naming
    -yeah i know, that's obvious
---------------------------------------------
6- 'Register' module
    line: 27 to 29
        if len(d) >= 1:
        print('logged in! ')
        logger.info(f'{self.username} logged in')
this part will make trouble, if u enter someone else's password, u will log in ://///
need to catch the number of specific row and match it with the next column
